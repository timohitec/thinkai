As engineers, our goal is to address real-world challenges. To achieve this, we conducted research to identify the specific problems Braunschweig residents encounter when dealing with forms. Our findings are as follows:


The people who took our survey are in these age groups

So because navigating the web online municipal services are complex. Our goal was to simplify this process by developing an intelligent chatbot that acts as a virtual assistant for accessing and using the city's online services.

Imagine you've just moved to Braunschweig and you're unsure about the next steps. Instead of sifting through the service portal of the city, you can simply engage with our chatbot. For example, you might say, "I just moved to Braunschweig, what should I do?" The chatbot would then guide you through the necessary steps, such as registering at the Rathaus.

But it doesn't stop thereâ€”the chatbot goes further by providing the relevant forms you need to fill out. It assists you in completing these forms by asking a series of questions and automatically populating the form with your answers. Once completed, you can easily print the form, sign it, and submit it.
